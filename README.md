# KeySlide
This is a demo for KeySlide idea.
Which is to use keyboard as a sliding panel.

Have you ever felt frustrated when you are writing code and you entered some typo because of typing too fast, then you have to hit the delete key for a couple of times or press and hold it for a while?

This is your saver (maybe).

just press and hold shift, then slide on keyboard from right to left (slide multiple times if it hasn't covered all the letters you want to delete).
Then release the shift.

Of course this is not serious. ;)
But also not that joke. :)
I want to use this project to practice my evaluation ability. 
User centered design is not dead. I still need to know it.
